## Ruby based forms, fields and widgets ##

Please see the file rwidgets.rb and rform.rb for the widgets and examples.
As of today, 25/11/2008 the above is just a few days old, please wait a bit 
for it to be tested and integrated more into some decent examples.

All the other files are my older work on an application generator using ncurses 
form and fields.
