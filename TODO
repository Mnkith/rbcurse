Note:

TODO_OLD relates to the Application generator I was writing.
There's a lot that works there. Given a table name you can do CRUD functions against it.

However, that uses the ncurses fields and forms. After creating fields in ruby, i've ditched that, and will perhaps redo that with rbcurses.

This todo relates to rbcurse, our own ruby fields, forms, widgets and application related goodies.

MUST DO:
========

- remove commonio.rb references from widget - DONE 2008-12-20 22:13 

1. popup lists/combo lists: correct inconsistency in firing of event. RETURN vs SELECT

2. cleanup scrollable code esp repaint method.

Thoughts:
=========

- filechooser
- quick dialogs for alert, confirm, etc

- widget - hotkey on label puts focus on that field, on using hotkey

- Action classes (like Java swing) which can be passed to a menu, button, or key. Also, disabling will disable for all.


- toolbar ?

- application class as per QT http://doc.trolltech.com/4.4-snapshot/mainclasses.html

- status bar, main window ?

- allow user to access history and enter from it, for field
