Note:

TODO_OLD relates to the Application generator I was writing.
There's a lot that works there. Given a table name you can do CRUD functions against it.

However, that uses the ncurses fields and forms. After creating fields in ruby, i've ditched that, and will perhaps redo that with rbcurses.

This todo relates to rbcurse, our own ruby fields, forms, widgets and application related goodies.

MUST DO:
========

    +----------+
    |  TO FIX  |
    +----------+

Some bugs in TextArea wrapping.
When a word is carried dowm, it shold gt carried back up too if i pt a space inside.

- can't call down up etc directly, since post_key still needs to be called. have to call handle_key KEY_UP etc.


add_observer - remove it. Featuritis.


1. popup lists/combo lists: correct inconsistency in firing of event. RETURN vs SELECT

2. cleanup scrollable code esp repaint method.

sizing of messageboxes


- scrollable Field and List and TextArea/View. programmatic scrolling
  setScrollOffset, making a row visible
  auto_scroll - done
  set_buffer alias set_text


Field to also have change event.

Save data from TextArea and see whether we've scrood it up or not.
With changes to Listbox (model) now list_variable seems useless.
Add tabbed pane to test2.rb and integrate so i see how it actually integrates.

For toggle, checkbutton etc it is variable, not textvariable

menu's Exit, throws close without destroying menu (i suspect). It should close menu then app

    +----------+
    |  TO ADD  |
    +----------+

- Listbox : status or detail, row m or n.
- Text Area: INS/OVW
- TextArea: choice of word wrap, col wrap or no wrap.

LABEL to take ampersand also. ?? No there could be legit ampersands. Also only if label_for.

Datamodel for TextArea/View so one can change display and do simple multiple columns
RowRenderer ?

3. Field and TextArea: OVERWRITE mode, 
   FIELD justification mode (after tabout), 
   FIELD - auto_skip (after reaching end), 

text components: get set add keymap, get action for keystroke etc
or will this make each widget heavy? TextArea/View may require for attaching actions/movement etc

Textarea del does not delete newline, although C-k does look into that.

Tabbedpane needs to look okay if change colors. At least should be able to switch to reverse.

Menuitem: disabled, what if no action (not armed).

Properties: redraw only when property change or data change, not each time. Esp for label.


if there is no next, should onleave be fired.

RECENTLY DONE:
--------------

if text_variable, when updateing value also puts object name, then it can multiplex across many objcts like a set of checkboxes, like a model ? One such object can be used fr all fields and inside it update a hash.

Togglebutton - selected (bool)
Label should be able to take height and wrap. - DONE 2008-12-30 23:52 
alert, confirm boxes in single line. put in test2 - done 2008-12-30 23:53 
- TextView and Area: current row, col. INS/OVW
- TextArea : show a $ if newline at end of line. DONE
TextArea: recursive wrap till end of para, otherwise words go out of buffer area. 2008-12-28 
cursor position in button, cb and radio - 2008-12-25 19:21 
Used ACS_ codes to make better boxes, wonder why I didn't do that before. Was going the lynx way.

Widget - event LEAVE and CHANGED should be separate. Currently validations happen on LEAVE.
 - Done. test more.

combo attr for position below, above, centered, on. - DONE
textarea and textview eating alt-keys! - DONE.

textarea - CHANGE Event must give meaningful details such as offset start/end of change, text added or removed, type of change (ADD/REM/CHANGE) as in Listbox. DONE.

Combo - list of 3 is showing only 2 in max visible, need to scroll down for 3rd/: @height helps

- quick dialogs for alert, confirm, etc
=========
Thoughts:
=========
text_variable etc: when set should class register with text_variable to be updated on change so it can repaint.
or should it always repaint by default, if based on Variable.

error messages - should they be popped up ? or choice of status bar and pop up.

- create and fire events only if someones listening. ??

- make a sample data entry form (CRUD), so we can see how things really work. 

- filechooser
- simple date widget YYYY-MM-DD using 3 fields

- Action classes (like Java swing) which can be passed to a menu, button, or key. Also, disabling will disable for all.

- toolbar ?

- application class as per QT http://doc.trolltech.com/4.4-snapshot/mainclasses.html

- status bar, main window ?

- allow user to access history and enter from it, for field
