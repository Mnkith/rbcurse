Note:

TODO_OLD relates to the Application generator I was writing.
There's a lot that works there. Given a table name you can do CRUD functions against it.

However, that uses the ncurses fields and forms. After creating fields in ruby, i've ditched that, and will perhaps redo that with rbcurses.

This todo relates to rbcurse, our own ruby fields, forms, widgets and application related goodies.

MUST DO:
========
- Define key for menu bar when creating, and set that to form. Currently, hardcoded.

1. popup lists/combo lists: only ENTER Closes
   - if single selection, only ENTER selects, no space etc.
   otherwise if listbox is in a form, allow selection, even single, with space or ;

2. cleanup scrollable code esp repaint method.

Thoughts:
=========

- widget - hotkey on label puts focus on that field, on using hotkey

- Action classes (like Java swing) which can be passed to a menu, button, or key. Also, disabling will disable for all.


- toolbar ?

- application class as per QT http://doc.trolltech.com/4.4-snapshot/mainclasses.html

- status bar, main window ?

- allow user to access history and enter from it, for field
