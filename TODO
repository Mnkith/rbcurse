Note:

TODO_OLD relates to the Application generator I was writing.
There's a lot that works there. Given a table name you can do CRUD functions against it.

However, that uses the ncurses fields and forms. After creating fields in ruby, i've ditched that, and will perhaps redo that with rbcurses.

This todo relates to rbcurse, our own ruby fields, forms, widgets and application related goodies.

MUST DO:
========

    +----------+
    |  TO FIX  |
    +----------+

Some bugs in TextArea wrapping.
When a word is carried dowm, it shold gt carried back up too if i pt a space inside.

- can't call down up etc directly, since post_key still needs to be called. have to call handle_key KEY_UP etc.


add_observer - remove it. Featuritis.


1. popup lists/combo lists: correct inconsistency in firing of event. RETURN vs SELECT

2. cleanup scrollable code esp repaint method.

sizing of messageboxes

LABEL to take ampersand also.
Label should be able to take height and wrap.

- scrollable Field and List and TextArea/View. programmatic scrolling
  setScrollOffset, making a row visible
  auto_scroll - done
  set_buffer alias set_text


Field to also have change event.

TextArea: recursive wrap till end of para, otherwise words go out of buffer area.

    +----------+
    |  TO ADD  |
    +----------+

- Listbox : status or detail, row m or n.
- TextView and Area: current row, col. INS/OVW
- TextArea : show a $ if newline at end of line. DONE
- TextArea: choice of word wrap, col wrap or no wrap.

alert, confirm boxes in single line. put in test2

Datamodel for TextArea/View so one can change display and do simple multiple columns
RowRenderer ?

3. Field and TextArea: OVERWRITE mode, 
   FIELD justification mode (after tabout), 
   FIELD - auto_skip (after reaching end), 

text components: get set add keymap, get action for keystroke etc
or will this make each widget heavy?


RECENTLY DONE:
--------------

cursor position in button, cb and radio - 2008-12-25 19:21 
Used ACS_ codes to make better boxes, wonder why I didn't do that before. Was going the lynx way.

Widget - event LEAVE and CHANGED should be separate. Currently validations happen on LEAVE.
 - Done. test more.

combo attr for position below, above, centered, on. - DONE
textarea and textview eating alt-keys! - DONE.

textarea - CHANGE Event must give meaningful details such as offset start/end of change, text added or removed, type of change (ADD/REM/CHANGE) as in Listbox. DONE.

Combo - list of 3 is showing only 2 in max visible, need to scroll down for 3rd/: @height helps

=========
Thoughts:
=========

- create and fire events only if someones listening. ??

- make a sample data entry form (CRUD), so we can see how things really work. 

- filechooser
- quick dialogs for alert, confirm, etc
- simple date widget YYYY-MM-DD using 3 fields

- Action classes (like Java swing) which can be passed to a menu, button, or key. Also, disabling will disable for all.

- toolbar ?

- application class as per QT http://doc.trolltech.com/4.4-snapshot/mainclasses.html

- status bar, main window ?

- allow user to access history and enter from it, for field
