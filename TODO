Note:

TODO_OLD relates to the Application generator I was writing.
There's a lot that works there. Given a table name you can do CRUD functions against it.

However, that uses the ncurses fields and forms. After creating fields in ruby, i've ditched that, and will perhaps redo that with rbcurses.

This todo relates to rbcurse, our own ruby fields, forms, widgets and application related goodies.

MUST DO:
========

    +----------+
    |  TO FIX  |
    +----------+

add_observer screwed up when i used ENTER to popup a list, and ENTER fired back !
Went into a loop.

cursor position in button, cb and radio

sizing of messageboxes

LABEL to take ampersand also.

- scrollable Field and List and TextArea/View. programmatic scrolling
  setScrollOffset, making a row visible
  auto_scroll - done
  set_buffer alias set_text

Combo - list of 3 is showing only 2 in max visible, need to scroll down for 3rd/

textarea - CHANGE Event must give meaningful details such as offset start/end of change, text added or removed, type of change (ADD/REM/CHANGE) as in Listbox.

textarea and textview eating alt-keys!

1. popup lists/combo lists: correct inconsistency in firing of event. RETURN vs SELECT

2. cleanup scrollable code esp repaint method.


Widget - event LEAVE and CHANGED should be separate. Currently validations happen on LEAVE.
 - Done. test more.

    +----------+
    |  TO ADD  |
    +----------+

3. Field and TextArea: OVERWRITE mode, 
   FIELD justification mode (after tabout), 
   FIELD - auto_skip (after reaching end), 

text components: get set add keymap, get action for keystroke etc

attr for position below, above, centered, on. - DONE
=========
Thoughts:
=========
- create and fire events only if someones listening.

- make a sample data entry form (CRUD), so we can see how things really work. 

- filechooser
- quick dialogs for alert, confirm, etc
- simple date widget YYYY-MM-DD using 3 fields

- Action classes (like Java swing) which can be passed to a menu, button, or key. Also, disabling will disable for all.


- toolbar ?

- application class as per QT http://doc.trolltech.com/4.4-snapshot/mainclasses.html

- status bar, main window ?

- allow user to access history and enter from it, for field
