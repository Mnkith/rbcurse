Subject: subwin benefit

Just found out after playing with subwins that they don't let you write onto  
the window below. Perfect for us for components that overwrite!!  However, no  
way to hide a subwin for later display

1. We need to use `create_buffer` either in constructor or repaint  
or whenever you are likely to have a width and height.  
Recommended in beginning of repaint().
Use `safe_create_buffer`

2. Use `@modified_buffer = true` in repaint

3. Ensure print_border and printstring are getting correct coordinates.  
Most errors happen here.

4. Replace @form.window with @graphic
