## Button which inherits label ##

circular order of navigation
editing taking care of different types of fields

WAIT. What is label doing inside FORM Why ? it can remain on Window, no ?
We are complicating code by inclusing in form and widgets.

## rform ruby forms fields ##

I am writing a simpler form and field thingie.
I know thats awfully ambitious, but the sequence of ncurses sucks.

We need to be more dynamic.
I have made a displayable form. But need to trap some keys are kick some asss.

## Fixes for smaller screens ##

A lot of hardcoding for large screens

     - changes in key labels
     - changes in data and col names
     - padrefresh
     - bug in pressing space
     - printing messages in centre, no more beeps please.
Now small screens can be requested.

## Cleanup , Refact and polishing output ##

1. cleaned up junk code

2. moved classes out. made key label printer into a class

3. common print modules

4. common db module

5. sizing of columns and formatting of titles

6. align of num fields

Also, therefore changed select functionality.

## key_labels ##

Worked on much better coded key_labels which don't require the poor hacky format the old one did
 Saner.
Also putting a message in -3 row and letting it go off. Its on the window. Goes off in next keystroke auto.

## flickering and key movement ##

       - reduced flickering by doing werase only when absolutely nec. but this could lead
         to some situations where clearing is not done. to keep checking.

       - some errors in key movement due to wrong @window value or space etc
         having incorrect checks. Need to keep checking.

## Regexp and symbols in mappings ##

In order that printables can be used had to add REGEXP in mapping.

Also added symbols

So now we can't search Hash normally, have to iterate. So ordered hash hadto beused.
Tried to move to arrays, but pendingkeys would have not been possible.
Symbols are not tested yet.

## sqlpopup and keymapper ##


We have a much simpler than VER keymapper. Code is small. 
      - Uses keyboard.rb from VER project to give us ESC and meta/alt keys.
      - We use same syntax for configuring such as class.let :mode do etc.
      - Provided:
               - single keys combinations
               - a mode with its set of keys
               - dual keys such as C-x C-c or C-x p etc which do not change mode.

frmincr200811120036.tgz
* * *
**2008-11-11 23:40**
## sqlpopup our own modes and key ##

allows cx mode with its keys
but its looks okay for a mode
for a multiple key we would prefer to say : C-c C-x
and not create a separate context./mode.

trying to build a simpler version of sqlpopup

kind of app.

## sqlview.rb ##

TABULAR sql view with much better scrolling like our old tabular thingie

## tabular view in pad ##

Used the pad program to give TABULAR View too.
SIMPLE view has column name and data per row.
ALTERNATING has name followed by data in next row.
TABULAR gives the entire result in one tabular form
TABULAR implements a search using "/" and ^N and ^P to go back/forth in search.

I need to make a selectable list which will return selectedrow, simple for use 
as help in dataentry forms.

## create_view_one_application ##

the first of the easy to call applications for a table, tell him you only want to view one
contract. The user can only quit from there. No operations possible.

Similarly now to do the view_any, delete_one, edit_one etc combinations.

## conditional submenu and sql options ##

Using @sql_actions, one can specify which options should be shown to user
   - retrict only to select, or upd/del etc, or give him no options
   - have to take care of bind keys also in this situation.
   - can start the program with a keyfield supplied
     or with the values to display supplied.

## basiceditform.rb ##

functionality moved down from rbeditform to basicedit which should be instantiated
hightlighting and helpproc display moved

## contractedit1101.rb ##

This conttains the contract edit with:
    - calls to create_default_application which takes care of windows etc
      So calling code is very few lines. Fully functional table realted CRUD screen.
    - ADded WHERE and ORDER BY in actions.
    - The search interface is still not clear. Using ^X-M for clearing screen and inserting.
      Can be confusing.

## more touches ##

     - moved commons into EditApplication, removed from main
     - entire header, footer creation in Edit Application.
     - Is this causing more confusion, or reducing,
     - main and app point to EA.
     - perhaps emailer should not extend Application ?

## form and field handlers ##

Done some changes to handlers, 
    
    - moved handle_unhandled_keys up to rbform
    - used method(:) while passing procs
    - trying to enforce usage of Proc or Method in handlers and not going to main
      or datasource to check for an existing name
      i.e. reduce coupling.
    - tested with emailer.rb

Am hoping to make sqlite etc based rbeditforms simpler to implement
by cutting out dataasource nad passing handlers in to the form.

This was having to be called by the user in form_post_proc
Now before save, heightwill be checked.

Howevr, this should happen auto. Added get_value and set_value in FIELD. and maybe thats

But we have to use it, too. We are using @current.

## Edit DSL ##

Finally got the email program running from a DSL.
One job pending still ... update_current_values.

    Finally i am trapping and doing an ungetch for which had to open the Ncurses class

3. Also allowing user to bind_key and use the REQ_ values

## gen4.rb EDIT FORM ##

I have the old gen2.rb redone into a datasource, rbeditform, editapplication.
Just about coming up!
Still many errors de to references from form to app.

Totally unclear here as to what the app is doing, and should it have all thefunctinolity
in it or not. Too much calling from form to app.

Its quite a mess and needs a major overhaul.

I also need to make changes so that rt_hashes and rt_fields dont have to be passed.

Application should only have what is required by the main app for setting up and cleaning ==
not all the stuff for regular work. 

Form should contain all else.

## running from menu ##

1.  Got the menu program working after all the changes in base classes.

2. Got programs running from menu. Apparently, some panels were not being 
   destroyed, so there was a BUS ERROR in update_panels.

3. There was a warning of BOTTOM_WIN_WIDTH already defined that was messing the screen
   and i could not see it clearly, so it bugged me a long time.

All's okay but the skel programs have to be updated. The menu DSL minp1 has to be rerun to see
if it gives correct output as per menu1.rb.
Basically, panels have to be returned with windows so they can be destroyed.

## form specific key labels - wip ##

Need to simplify it.
qapp returns keylabels but does not support a keys_handled

Application.rb checks for this.

## panelreader ##
deleting panel in ensure otherwise previous screen wuld be scr00d.

define a page. It by default pops up TODO !

**2008-10-09 18:02**

More polishing on panelreader.rb
But cannot get the line numbers correct.
Also if I display line # on top, then cursor remains there.
If i put the print statemnet at beg of loop, the line number is wonky.
It is correct at end of loop, but then the cursor is stuck on top.

## handling of cursor and selection in subseq queries ##

especially if:
  
  *  fewer queries returned in second query
  *  no queries returned in second query

  Now cursor will always be in row one after a fresh query when you tab.
  Can't tab in if no rows.

* * *
**2008-10-08 17:51**

## get_curr_index bug ##

this was returning one more (base 1) so some users were doing -1
Some methods were getting wrong curr_item like the handle_? methods.

User cannot tab into table if no data.

Issue of wrong header count if no rows also fixed.

**2008-10-08 14:48**

Moved stuff to Datasource class.
Also checked out more stuff from DSL
Added keys_handled to DLS and tested it.

**2008-10-07 22:40**

1. based on datatype, aligning fields in table 
2. based on datatype, using = in search query for integer and real and smallint
