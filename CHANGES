#  NCURSES APPLICATION GENERATOR #
 
## 2008-10-05 15:02 
   This zip with query.rb and queryapplication, tableapplication, and the related forms,
   is a working refactored to a large extent version.
   Last changes were to see that cursor is visible when we tab, and the first row is 
   shown as selected.

   ### menu file ###

   Worked on menu file last night and got a replica of Pines first page.
   Today got a DLS to generate the same.

   However, to call screens from it, we need to make a class with same name as file name,
   and a run program. Constructor should take stdscr. all windows to be panelled. And windows 
   and panels to be destroyed at close. That means rework in the form.skel !!!

   *infile*
  
   Currently reading in from "infile" and only yaml. Checking for data in buffer against
   what was to be put in: if nil then we first chomp. Check again, if still nil, then
   do text_to_multiline

   ### templates ###

   Have implemented templates for saving data. This was required for testing the below function, of
sending mail through sendmail - piping to sendmail. Use `save_template` for this. See form2.rb.

   However, pls note that we can't deal with a conditional, such as if cc is blank, don't pass. I don;t know if sendmail will grip with a blank cc.

   ### pipe_output_path ##

   Just like alpine, we can give a command to which we will pipe the output - i used the `sendmail -t`
   example in form2.rb, along with the above format. It works fine.

   ### multi-line fields - populate ###
   
   I am now able to populate large multiline values into such fields. Good!
   They are a cranky lot. Need to remove all newlines. Need to then pad them to 60 (width) and then set_field_buffer. btw, you may have to chomp! the result of a system command when set_field_buffer is used.

  ### onfocus  ###
   
  A field can specify an onenter proc. Will be called when field is entered. Similar to our
  helpproc. (to be tested)

  ### dependent fields ###
     
   *aka publish/subscribe*
   Just implemented with `observes` verb and update_func in form3.rb and gen3.rb

   However, since all fields areimplemented as strings, user has to convert in the update_func
   during calculations. All values must be put back as strings, esp in @current 
   or runtime errors will result.

   * defaults *
   Working well. Saving clears and sets defaults. Before saving, blanks fields defaulted.
   Can pass values through a hash too.

   *post form proc*
   also working if defined by user

   * multiline working well now.
 
      *    I am allowing key up and down to work for fields and within a multiline field.
      *    I have written a procedure to split and strip and add newlines before saving.
      *    So now a post_proc can be defined per field level as a symbol. I still have not figured
           out how to specify the params to pass -- what if a user wants more than one field, or all fields. Perhaps give him field object itself, and let him hack it ! Or give him a hash with values he can update and pass back.

    * multi-line fields

      I have implemented it in form2 like a mail program. However, the data saved is not consistent. 
      I think we have to move out of field for it to register. Else nothing will be saved.

      Also, mainly NEW_LINES are not saved. So there is a huge amount of white space, and thus
     the saved data looks odd.

    * Also took care of user defined field positions. and label positions based on
    field positions.

##  2008-09-19 16:16 
  
    * Added a hash named current. 
    * Also checking valid regexp altho it is better to just use REGEXP.
##  2008-09-18 18:29 

    *  Generating help messages at generate time, so it can be touched up by user.
       Earlier it was determined at runtime

##  2008-09-18 15:13 

   *  Added opts on and off and fore/just/pad.

Taking help out of field, makes it less appealing since the cursor moves
with mvaddstr and it is outside of window. I can only pass one set of fields to win.

Help field no longer part of fields array. so no longer need to skip first field
I need to check for sysfields[0] instead of fields[0]

##  2008-09-17 18:45 
Now only hashes.yml with same name as rb file.
Other arrays have been copied into code, so no need to yamlize. But hashes.yml was large, looked ugly
inside code, so it remains in yaml, like a .h file.

Put default value feature, help on entering field.
