## multiline fields ##

 allergic to newlines : we had fixed that
 allergic to tabs also - will not display a field with tabs !!!
 allergic to non-print chars use %s/[^[:print:]]//g
 

## user_objects ##

when clearing fields and reusing, be sure to clear user_objects too.

## moving out of a field ##

Unless user moves out of a field, the value does not seem to set. I have tried REQ values. So using some other key, does not pick up the entered value.

## multiline default values ##

This goes for normal fields too. One is not sure when a default value will populate
a field using set_field_buffer and when not. (Ans: this has to do with newlines, remove newlines)

I read in a file, and tried setting the multiline field to that. Did not work. Tried setting first 50 chars of ml field to that and still no result.

## ruby backticks ##

These are working in irb but when i try setting a field using set_field_buffer with a command using
backticks or %x sometimes it works.
``pwd`` works. However "echo HELLO" does not. Nor do most other things I tried.
(Ans: chomp() a field, to remove newlines)
